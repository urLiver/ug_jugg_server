## Knonw Bugs:
* Having any form off custom chat tag, color and so on, will cause you to not be able to use teamchat anymore as we print any given message to all users

## TODO List:
* Ohm:
  * Start Work on it, main focus is on Trolling / Enhancing Expierence with Fun Mods
* Finish the re-writing of gc scripts such as objects.gsc, voting.gsc
* Finish switching systems such as in ui.gsc to only use ui_func.gsc
* Killstreaks:
  * Grenade Launcher Turret
  * Placeable Turret that becomes useable by Players
  * Drone Strike or similar, for example bo2 airstrike or mw3 spec ops air strike
  * Helicopter Flock, but with littlebirds and them spawning with a 20% chance
  * Predator Rocket allowing to press usebutton or so to turn into cluster strike like Advanced Warfare
  * Nuke -> Turn back to the og one with smoke, vision and so on
* Infected Rolls:
  * Commander -> Wears a Flag on the back and speeds up ( 20% increase ) close mates for 4 seconds every 7 seconds
  * Hunter -> The Juggernaut from Call of Duty Ghost that is fast and has only a knive
  * Cloaker -> On death gets hidden for 3 Seconds before reappearing
  * Rocket Ride -> You get an rpg with one bullet and when you shit it it links to the rocket till impact could work goodly out tho unsure
  * Push Nade -> Pushes anyone like the pushlauncher but a bit further
* Possibily Remove AFK and Not in Edit Kick, so new players dont get punished when joining late a round
